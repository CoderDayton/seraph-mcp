Seraph MCP â€” Core Runtime

Minimal AI optimization platform following SDD.md architecture.

This package provides the core runtime with:
- Configuration management (typed Pydantic models)
- Cache abstraction with pluggable backends
- Observability adapter (metrics, traces, logs)
- Error handling with typed exceptions
- HTTP server with health/readiness endpoints

Following SDD.md mandatory rules:
- Minimal core: Only essential functionality
- Single adapters: One factory/adapter per capability
- Plugin architecture: Heavy features as separate plugins
- Type safety: All config via Pydantic validation
- Observability: Structured logs with trace IDs

Usage:
    from src.config import load_config
    from src.cache import create_cache
    from src.observability import get_observability

    config = load_config()
    cache = create_cache()
    obs = get_observability()
